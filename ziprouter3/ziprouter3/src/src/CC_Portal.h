 * The Z/IP Portal Command Class is used for configuration and management
 * communication between a Z/IP portal server and a Z/IP gateway through
 * a secure connection.
 *
 * The Z/IP Portal command class is intended for use together with the Z/IP Gateway
 * command class to provide a streamlined workflow for preparing and performing
 * installation of Z/IP Gateways in consumer premises.
 *
 * The command class MUST NOT be used outside trusted environments,
 * unless via a secure connection. The command class SHOULD be further
 * limited for use only via a secure connection to an authenticated portal server.
