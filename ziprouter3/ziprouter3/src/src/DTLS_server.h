 * Z/IP LAN security provides a secure connection for clients, and other Z/IP Gateways,
 * connecting to the Z/IP Gateway. The Z/IP LAN Security framework provides a means
 * of securing the communication paths between:
 *
 *   - Z/IP Clients
 *   - Z/IP Clients and Z/IP Gateways
 *   - Z/IP Gateways.
 *
 * Starting with Z/IP Gateway 2.x it is mandatory to send secure Z/IP UDP frames to and
 * from the gateway. The same mechanism may be used to send secure Z/IP UDP frames between
 * Z/IP Clients, and between Z/IP Gateways.
 *
 * Secure Z/IP UDP frames are ordinary Z/IP frames wrapped in a DTLS 1.0 wrapper. DTLS is
 * the datagram version of TLS. Z/IP LAN Security default UDP port number is 41230.
 *
 * This current version of Z/IP LAN Security only supports the Pre-Shared-Key
 * (PSK) Key Exchange Algorithm.
