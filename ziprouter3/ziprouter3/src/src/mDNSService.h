 *
 * The mDNS service allows an IP application automatically discover all Z-Wave nodes
 * available on any Full Z/IP Gateway on the backbone. The application will receive
 * information about all nodes added to the network as well as any changes that may be made.
 * The mDNS discovery service must announce all nodes and node endpoints as individual
 * mDNS resources (see draft-cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd.). As new nodes are added and removed
 * from the Z-Wave network the mDNS resource changes must be dynamically
 * multicast on the LAN backbone. The mDNS resource announcements must contain detailed
 * information about the underlying node/endpoint such as its device type and supported
 * command classes and IPv6 address(es).
 *
 * The names of the mDNS resources are statically generated.
